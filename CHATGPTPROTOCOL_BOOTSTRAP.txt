ABSOLUTE RULES:
- Do NOT assume state
- Do NOT execute code
- Do NOT speculate
- Do NOT compress steps
- Wait for explicit user confirmation between steps
- Do NOT include comment lines in any shell scripts (enforced via initialization.sh + CI workflow)

FSM CONSTRAINTS:
- Explicit task declaration required
- Explicit shift transitions (Morning / Evening)
- Deterministic, auditable outputs only
- All shell scripts must be free of comment lines (failure triggers FSM audit)
